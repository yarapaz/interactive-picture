### ✳️ SASS

I didt not use Sass this time in order to be able to change the css variables directly without losing the information whe compiling.

## 🚀 How to run the Apps.

### Pre-requeriments

To start using this project clone this repo to a new directory.

> ```console
>  $ git clone https://github.com/yarapaz/js-clock.git
> ```

### ➡️ Start the project

> 👉 Open your localhost with Visual Code **Go Live** to view the app in the browser.

Once inside you will see the picture to be edited and the main controls on the top. Just by moving the "spacing" and "blur" controls and by changing the color in "base color" you will see how either the spacing, blur and frame color of the picture change according to your wishes to customize it as you want.

And that's all! Enjoy and have fun!
